            <p>
            The saxophone family comes in many sizes and voices, each with its own sound and character. 
            While there are more than a dozen variations, four main types are the most common and widely used in both classical and modern music: 
            soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones.

            <h2> The Soprano Saxophone </h2>
            <p>
            The soprano saxophone is the smallest of the four main types and produces the highest pitch. Its bright and clear tone makes it ideal for solo performances, jazz, 
            and expressive melodies. Because it’s straight and slender, it looks a bit like a gold clarinet. 
            The soprano saxophone requires precise control, but its sound can be beautifully pure and emotional.

            <h2>The Alto Saxophone</h2>
            <P>
            The alto saxophone is the most popular choice for beginners and students. 
            It has a medium size and a warm, rich tone that balances power and smoothness. 
            The alto is widely used in jazz bands, concert bands, and even pop music. 
            Its flexibility makes it a favorite among players of all skill levels.

            <h2>The Tenor Saxophone</h2>
            <p>
            The tenor saxophone is slightly larger and deeper in tone than the alto. It produces a bold, full sound that’s often described as soulful or smoky. 
            The tenor has become a symbol of jazz, made famous by legends like John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins. Its relaxed, confident tone also fits well in blues and rock music.

            <h2>The Baritone</h2>
            <p>
            The baritone saxophone, often called the “bari sax,” is the largest and lowest-pitched of the common saxophones. 
            It delivers a deep, resonant sound that adds strength and richness to ensembles. 
            Though heavy and less common for solos, the baritone is essential in jazz bands, marching bands, and orchestras for its grounding presence.
